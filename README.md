### Salut

Hello, I'm CS student at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology. My interests lie in operating systems, Nix and computational physics. I'm an active member of PWR in Space student scientific association.

At the scientific association I work on various tasks, from process automation, computational physics and embedded programing to Ansys CFDs and workshop stuff.

#### Few of my projects
- [pdftms](https://github.com/pingponghero12/pdftms) is a CLI managment system for PDF files. It is a simple app based on obsidian-vault.
- [ScienceArch](https://github.com/pingponghero12/ScienceArch) a website still in development, that will make it easy to track and find scientific content you read.
- [srcli](https://github.com/pingponghero12/CLI-Spaced-Repetition-For-Obsidian) is an obsidian spaced repetition command-line tool designed for maximal simplicity.
- [lsh](https://github.com/pingponghero12/lsh) a minimal shell. Supports pipes and background processes.
- [chinese-checkers](https://github.com/pingponghero12/Chinese-Checkers) a client-server GUI application for playing chinese checkers. Writen in C++, with GUI in PyQt5.

Besides that, I love to automate things I do on my computer. So feel free to check my [Automation](https://github.com/pingponghero12/Automation) repository, with scripts that I use on daily basis.

### NEVER GIVE UP!
