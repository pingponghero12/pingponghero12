Hello, I'm student from Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology. I'm interested in physics simulations and CFDs. My top 1 time waster is configuration of linux and nvim.

Most of my simulation and scientific assosiation related work is private, I will publish it when the time is right.

#### My example projects.
1. [srcli](https://github.com/pingponghero12/CLI-Spaced-Repetition-For-Obsidian) is a simple command-line spaced repetition tool designed for use with Obsidian.
2. [PPH-Ubuntu-Setup](https://github.com/pingponghero12/PPH-Ubuntu-Setup) is a basic i3 setup with nvim and someother stuff for Ubuntu.
3. [WRS](https://github.com/pingponghero12/Water-rocket-simulator) old work of mine, don't you dare to look at the code, it's unbelivably garbage. But simulations work, so if you want to get thrust generated by water with pressurized gas then go and check it out.

### NEVER GIVE UP!
