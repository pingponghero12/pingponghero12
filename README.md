### Salut

Hello, I'm CS student at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology. My interests lie in computational physics, scietific computing and science. I'm an active member of PWR in Space student scientific association and intern at European Space Agency.

#### Few of my projects
- [pdftms](https://github.com/pingponghero12/pdftms) is a fzf for your pdf files. I really recommend it, just `pdftms` into `cormen` into Cormen ofc.
- [ScienceArch](https://github.com/pingponghero12/ScienceArch) damn I need to finish this, it would be so useful.
  
I used to have time automate things I do on my computer. Feel free to check tools I made during that period [Automation](https://github.com/pingponghero12/Automation). I use them daily.

### NEVER GIVE UP!
